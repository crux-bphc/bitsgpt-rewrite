# ðŸŽ“ BitsGPT 2.0

BitsGPT is a chatbot designed for the students of BPHC. It uses an agentic framework to provide accurate and reliable responses to a variety of queries related to campus life, academics, and placements. This rewrite improves modularity, accuracy, and performance.

## Features

- **Query Classification**: Automatically detects query intent (campus queries, course-related, PS/placement-related, etc.).
- **Tool-Based Query Handling**: Uses dedicated tools for data retrieval based on query intent.
- **Reliable and Modular Design**: Built with LangGraph and Langchain for agentic capabilities.
